Line 2 loads the bokeh library. The third line makes sure that we will see the actual plots inline in our ipython notebook. The magic starts to happen at line 5, where we **create a new empty figure** and set its dimensions. In this case, we'll generate a picture of 500x500 pixels (see [here](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/reference/models/plots.html#bokeh.models.plots.Plot) for information on arguments used). On line 6, we remove the gridlines that are are shown by default (see [here](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/styling.html#grids) for info on grids). See what happens if your removed this line... Next, we add a **circle** to the picture with the (horizontal) x-position set to 100 and the (vertical) y-position set to 150. The radius is defined as 20 pixels, and we colour it red. There are 2 types of colour commands: **`fill_color`** defines the colour of the mass of a marker, whereas **`line_color`** refers to the colour of the line around the object. For a circle, therefore, the `fill_color` sets the colour of the *disk* whereas `line_color` defines the colour of the circle around the disk.\n",
        "Next, we draw a **rectangle** with its center position set at (200,200), a width of 50 pixels, a height of 60 pixels, and make it green. We also draw a **line** from the point (10,5) to the point (280,250). The first parameter of the `p.line` command should be a list of the x-positions; the second parameter a list of the y-positions. Finally, in line 9, we show the actual picture.\n",

In this loop, we go through the numbers 0 to 9, put these in a variable called `i`, and use that variable in line 11.

The values -180 and 180 define the *domain* of the data, whereas 0 and 800 define the *range*. Other plotting libraries (e.g. processing.org (java) or p5js.org (javascript)) provide a function (called `map`) that does this as well. See the figure below.\n",
